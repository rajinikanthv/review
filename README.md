1. clFormWindow - Standard windows api declaration and its implementation - Nothing to be verified / checked here.

Tips:Identify unused modules / functions and remove them - Not sure whether the functionality in DisableShift and ExcelMacro is used anywhereMove the hardcoded values from main module / procedure to Constants to enable easier code maintenanceMake use of Option Explicit to avoid unintended creation of variables and inappropriate date typesMovetoMiddle - GetTaskBarSize not usedTempBCLPosting - Lot of hardcoded variables (share folders, file creation paths etc) could be moved to ini files enabling easier update as and when required with no change in underlying code 'read   Private Declare Function GetPrivateProfileString Lib "kernel32" Alias "GetPrivateProfileStringA" _                 (ByVal lpApplicationName As String, _                   ByVal lpKeyName As String, _                   ByVal lpDefault As String, _                   ByVal lpReturnedString As String, _                   ByVal nSize As Long, _                   ByVal lpFileName As String) As Long   'write   Private Declare Function WritePrivateProfileString Lib "kernel32" Alias "WritePrivateProfileStringA" _                 (ByVal lpApplicationName As String, _                   ByVal lpKeyName As String, _                   ByVal lpString As String, _                   ByVal lpFileName As String) As Longhttps://bytes.com/topic/access/answers/557917-reading-writing-ini-files-using-vba-code
Database master tables or ini files/text files could be used instead of hardcoding the values in the code
Using ini files for field capture could eliminate creation of each module for a circle and a single module can handle the entire functionality.Code for TempBCLPosting will become fully generic instead of handling multiple case statements
Use instr to eliminate multiple If conditions for eg If browser.Title = "*Login" Or browser.Title = "Login" ThenIf browser.Title = "*Accounts Receivable" Or browser.Title = "Accounts Receivable" Then 
Only difference noticed in CloseinCRM functions is hardcoding of URLs.
BrowserErrorReRun - why only in some circles
BCLPostingsHaryana and BCLPostingsPunjab - Duplicate code in main function and in the Goto Condition BrowserErrorReRun - code can be put in a common function

Only the following  minor differences has been observed in the module code of all the circles
Delhicontrol: name=beID,value=1130489
Call browser.FindElement("a", "uiname=MUM").Click  (should it be DEL)?
Gujaratcontrol: ("select", "name=env").Select("vel1_PE")some code related to Accounts Receivable

Mumbai - not much except one variable name reversed errorreason

suggested to have a single generic function in one module called BCLPostings to handle functionality of all the circles
function CloseinCRMUPW
4 URLs identified for each circle that are found to be different. Apart from that the code is the same for all the circles.
suggested to have a single generic function in one module called ClostinCRM to handle functionality of all the circles
