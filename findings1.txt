1.	clFormWindow - Standard windows api declaration and its implementation - Nothing to be verified / checked here.




Tips:
Identify unused modules / functions and remove them - Not sure whether the functionality in DisableShift and ExcelMacro is used anywhere
Move the hardcoded values from main module / procedure to Constants to enable easier code maintenance
Make use of Option Explicit to avoid unintended creation of variables and inappropriate date types
MovetoMiddle - GetTaskBarSize not used
TempBCLPosting - Lot of hardcoded variables (share folders, file creation paths etc) could be moved to ini files enabling easier update as and when required with no change in underlying code

Database master tables or ini files/text files could be used instead of hardcoding the values in the code

Using ini files for field capture could eliminate creation of each module for a circle and a single module can handle the entire functionality.
Code for TempBCLPosting will become fully generic instead of handling multiple case statements

Use instr to eliminate multiple If conditions for eg 
If browser.Title = "*Login" Or browser.Title = "Login" Then
If browser.Title = "*Accounts Receivable" Or browser.Title = "Accounts Receivable" Then 

Only difference noticed in CloseinCRM functions is hardcoding of URLs.

BrowserErrorReRun - why only in some circles

BCLPostingsHaryana and BCLPostingsPunjab - Duplicate code in main function and in the Goto Condition BrowserErrorReRun - code can be put in a common function
